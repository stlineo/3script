# 3script
a dumb script i started making at 1 am because i got extremely bored.
this is basically just a 622 megabyte folder that includes a python script and a bunch of installers for the different options listed in the program.

what this entire piece of trash does is basically a window with a ton of options to choose from including installing browsers, use a debloating program, do the yarr me matey (pirating) your windows activation and some registry stuff you can change

### installation
just download and run `Install3script.bat` from the releases tab :fr:
