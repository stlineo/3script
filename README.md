######if you're wondering why the code has a `folder.txt` file its because github wont let me upload installers.

# 3script
a dumb script i started making at 1 am because i got extremely bored.
this is basically just a 622 megabyte folder that includes a python script and a bunch of installers for the different options listed in the program.

what this entire piece of trash does is basically a window with a ton of options to choose from including installing browsers, use a debloating program, do the yarr me matey (pirating) your windows activation and some registry stuff you can change

just be aware this doesnt install updated versions of software so after installing i highly recommmend updating the software you got (especially browsers).

### stuff needed

- python 3.11 installed (best to get it from microsoft store. idk why but the ms store version worked for me.)

### installation
just download and run `Install3script.bat` from the releases tab :fr:

### how to run this garbage

wait for `Install3script.bat` finishes downloading.

once its done open up PowerShell and type "python3 C:\3script\3script\script.py" or "python C:\3script\3script\script.py"
